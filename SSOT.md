# Project SSOT (Pointer)

This repository’s canonical SSOT guide lives in `docs/SSOT.md`.

- **In this repo**: `docs/SSOT.md` is the authoritative SSOT guide (documentation-first).
- **If you are adopting this**: copy/rename `docs/SSOT.md` into your own repo root as `/SSOT.md` and treat that as the *Project SSOT*.

## Canonical
- `docs/SSOT.md`

## Why this file exists
This pointer prevents confusion between:
- the *guide* inside this repository (`docs/SSOT.md`), and
- the *Project SSOT* file that adopters should place at repo root (`/SSOT.md`).
